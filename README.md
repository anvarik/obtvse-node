[Obtvse](http://github.com/NateW/obtvse) nodejs implementation. 

## About
[Obtvse] (https://github.com/natew/obtvse) is developed by [@natew](https://github.com/natew) with Ruby&Rails. 
I am not familiar with Ruby&Rails and I thought it is a good opportunity to make it work with nodejs. [@gorekee](https://github.com/gorekee) has already [started](https://github.com/gorekee/obtvse-node.js) and he 
is currently busy to continue. I asked his permission, and will be copying his code and rewriting most of it to create a full nodejs implementation.

## Configuration
Set MySql database and login information into the config.json under user/password.
Set Admin module login information under login.user/login.password. 
First run `npm install` for dependencies, then run `node app.js` in order to start the server.
